          I'm an aspiring Frontend engineer. Soon to be certified from
          IT-HÃ¶gskolan, Stockholm. I'm new to the field and I'd love to hear
          about your website project you've been thinking about. I'm also
          proficient with photoshop and design in general. Explore my portfolio
          to see what projects I have been working on.
